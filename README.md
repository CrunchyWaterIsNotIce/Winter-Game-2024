_"sliding down a mountain shooting ~~snowballs~~ bullets."_

This project delves into learning game development utilizing one of python's popular game library: *Pygame*. By using Pygame for this project, it
allows me to experience developing a game-structure from the ground up: including the design of a program framework to tackle smooth in-game 
transitions (i.e., menu to game, game to end, etc.) and/or the implementation of my own animation state machine. All in all, this passion project
will show my resolution to polishing my first ever game.
